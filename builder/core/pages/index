We offer a huge in-stock selection to choose from all at unbeatable warehouse-direct pricing.

And because it's in-stock you can pick up your new flooring same-day or schedule a professional installation with minimal lead-time.</p>
			<p>Here at Vallejo Floor Company we don't want your budget to limit your flooring choices to boring, bland, or low quality.  That's why instead of simply selling <u>cheap</u> goods we focus on giving you quality and fashion from brands such as Mohawk, Shaw, Beaulieu, Millstone, Tarkett, and Pergo at the <u>absolute best value</u>.</p>
